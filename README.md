# Django_API

![img.png](img/img.png)
<p>A REST API is a standardized way to provide data to other
applications. Those applications can then use the data 
however they want. Sometimes, APIs also offer a way for 
other applications to make changes to the data.</p>

There are a few key options for a REST API request:
<li>
GET ‚Äî The most common option, returns some data from the API based on the 
endpoint you visit and any parameters you provide</li>
<li>POST ‚Äî Creates a new record that gets appended to the database</li>
<li>PUT(UPDATE) ‚Äî Looks for a record at the given URI you provide. If it exists, 
update/overwrite the existing record. If not, create a new record</li>
<li>DELETE ‚Äî Deletes the record at the given URI</li>

NB: We will use Postman for the API, but you can use any of your preference
